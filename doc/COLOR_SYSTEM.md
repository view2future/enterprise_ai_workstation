# Modern Color System for Enterprise AI Dashboard

## Overview

This dashboard now features a modern, technology-inspired color system designed to provide better contrast, improved readability, and a contemporary aesthetic that aligns with modern AI/enterprise software interfaces.

## Color Palette Design Philosophy

### Light Mode Design
- **Background**: A very light blue-gray (#F8FAFC) instead of stark white for better eye comfort during long working sessions
- **Text**: Deep blue-gray (#0F172A) for maximum readability and contrast
- **Accent Colors**: Modern blues and teals that convey technology and innovation
- **Borders and UI Elements**: Carefully chosen blue-grays for subtle definition without visual noise

### Dark Mode Design
- **Background**: Deep blue-gray (#0F172A) for comfortable viewing in low-light conditions
- **Text**: Light blue-gray (#F8FAFC) for excellent contrast against dark backgrounds
- **Accent Colors**: Bright, saturated blues that pop against dark backgrounds
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Darker shades for depth and lighter accents for emphasis
